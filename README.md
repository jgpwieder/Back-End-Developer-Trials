# Back-End-Developer-Trials

2 different scripts were generated for this challenge, I ran the script partially on a cloud VM and also fully local, there are 2 versions of the Invoice_Caller, one to run on windows and another one to run on Ubuntu (Linux) whic is the cloud VM that I used :
- Partially on cloud: Using a Ubuntu virtual machine on AWS, run the branch Invoice_Caller_Cloud, while the branch Transfer_Listener ran locally.
- Fully local: Using 2 command prompts, first run the branch Transfer_Listener and then run the branch Invoice_Caller_Local
