# Back-End-Developer-Trials

2 different scripts were generated for this challenge, first I ran the scripts fully locally and then I uploaded the Invoice_Caller to a AWS VM. There are 2 versions of the Invoice_Caller, one to run on windows and another one to run on Ubuntu (Linux), which is the cloud VM that I used:
- Partially on cloud: Using a Ubuntu virtual machine on AWS, run the branch Invoice_Caller_Cloud, while the branch Transfer_Listener ran locally.
- Fully locally: Using 2 command prompts, first run the branch Transfer_Listener and then run the branch Invoice_Caller_Local
